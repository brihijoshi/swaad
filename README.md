## Motivation

The [UN's Sustainable Development Goals Action Campaign](https://sdgactioncampaign.org/) is a cooperative effort to develop a sustainable thinking and tangible approaches towards sustainability. In 2018, [The Chef's Manifesto](http://www.sdg2advocacyhub.org/chefmanifesto) was one of the winners of the UN SDG Action Campaign Award, to create a more holistic approach toward's sustainability, from the perspective of food. Since food production cannot be avoided, it is important to reduce it's wastage. But the question is, can we do something similar at home? 

> In the U.S., up to 40 percent of all food goes uneaten each year, at an annual cost of $218 billion!

Given the increase in awareness of this issue, several ideas like Waste Management Systems, Smart Fridges, etc, have been built, but with an increase in effort and cost.
